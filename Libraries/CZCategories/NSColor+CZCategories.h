/** Adds a method for obtaining a CGColorRef equivalent to the receiver.ï¿¼
 
 The iPhone OS's class UIColor has a convenience method, -CGColor, that helps a lot when writing CoreGraphics code. NSColor is missing this method out-of-the-box, thus this category.

 This method calculates and returns a CGColorRef with the same colorspace and components as the receiver. It also contains exception handling to that returns a clear color if the receiver is a pattern, as CGColorRefs cannot contain patterns.
